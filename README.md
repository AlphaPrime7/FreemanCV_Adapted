# FreemanCV_Adapted
- This is the FreemanCV adapted from the author Alessandro Plasmati.
- This template was chosen because it was a single page, and also, the class code was not crazy at first sight, NOT that I know the first thing about latex, but I have seen some very weird class files that make you want to take an eternal nap.
- I did not anticipate modifying the class file until recent requests from recruiters, and that prompted me to check it out; it seemed my choice to use this template was on point because the class file was easily modified. There is more for me to know to achieve excellent formatting in Excel.
- There are 2 class files: one that is the original file and the other modified by me. In that regard, there are 2 tex files to match the class files.


## What to Watch For
- The modified class where I include bullet points presents some formatting issues, so the fix has been to go into Acrobat Pro and move things around to ensure they don't look weird. This is a bit of a pain, but that has worked so far.
- If you choose the original template, you will not be able to make bullet points, which seems to be the preferred way for most recruiters.
- Now, I am no LATEX expert.
